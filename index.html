I'M REALLY INTERESTED IN <b>BLOCKCHAIN, OFFENSIVE SECURITY, AND APP DEVELOPMENT.</b><br><br>WHEN I'M NOT WORKING ON TECH PROJECTS, YOU'LL FIND ME <b>WRITING POEMS, WATCHING ANIME, PLAYING VIDEO GAMES, OR LISTENING TO MUSIC.</b> I'M ALWAYS UP FOR LEARNING NEW THINGS AND TAKING ON NEW CHALLENGES.<br><br><b>WANNA TALK ?

    <h1>EXPERIENCE</h1>
    <div class="experience_panel_1">
        <img src="assets/python.png"></img>
        <p><b>PYTHON</b> WAS MY VERY FIRST LANGUAGE AND HONESTLY IS ONE OF MY FAVOURITE AND GO-TO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. IT IS VERY VERSATILE AND I'VE WORKED WITH IT FOR A LOT OF PROJECTS RANGING FROM CREATING <b>SIMPLE SYSTEM AUTOMATION TOOLS</b> TO <b>SOPHISTICATED APPS AND GAMES.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel">
        <p><b>BURPSUITE</b> IS THE BEST TOOL FOR <b>BUG BOUNTY HUNTERS AND PENTESTERS</b> WHEN IT COMES TO NETWORK INTERCEPTION AND THAT'S THE MAJOR REASON I LOVE USING BURP AND BY ADDING BURP I JUST DONT MEAN BURP ,I'M WELL VERSED IN OTHER PENTESTING TOOLS LIKE <b>WIRESHARK, NMAP, FFUF, HYDRA, GOBUSTER, AND CRYPTOGRAPHIC ALGORITHMS</b> LIKE THE <b>SHA-256 AND RSA.</b></p>
        <img src="assets/burp.png"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel_1">
        <img src="assets/cpp.png"></img>
        <p><b>C++</b> FALLS UNDER THE SAME BRACKET AS PYTHON FOR ME BUT I DON'T HOLD AS MUCH AS EXPERIENCE AS I DO WITH PYTHON. CPP WOULD BE MY GO-TO PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE FOR <b>COMPETITVE CODING</b> DUE TO ITS EXCEPTIONALLY FAST COMPILE TIME. I AM ALSO INTERESTED IN TRYING OUT THE RENDERING LIBRARIES LIKE THE INFAMOUS <b>GLFW AND RAYLIB.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel">
        <p>I PRIMARILY USE <b>JAVASCRIPT</b> FOR WEB DEVELOPMENT AS MOST OF THE DEVELOPERS DO. THE FRAMEWORK SUPPORT THAT <b>JAVASCRIPT</b> PROVIDES IS REALLY EXCEPTIONAL WHICH INCLUDES FRONT-END FRAMEWORKS LIKE THE <b>REACT FRAMEWORK</b>, BACKEND FRAMEWORKS LIKE <b>NODE JS</b>. I'M PLANNING ON DIVING DEEP FURTHUR INTO FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT BY LEARNING META FRAMEWORKS LIKE <b>NEXT JS AND THREE JS.</b></p>
        <img src="assets/js.png"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel_1">
        <img src="assets/linux.png"></img>
        <p><b>LINUX</b> IS MY GO TO OPERATING SYSTEM OR SHOULD I SAY KERNEL ,WHEN IT COMES TO DEVELOPMENT AND BUG BOUNTY HUNTING DUE TO IT BEING VERY TRANSPARENT ABOUT ALL THE SYSTEM LOGS AND THE CLI SUPPORT IT PROVIDES REALLY HELPS ME WHILE <b>BUG BOUNTY HUNTING</b>. I'VE USED SEVERAL DISTROS OVER THE PAST YEARS ,STARTED WITH <b>UBUNTU</b> AND WENT ON WITH <b>MANJARO LINUX</b>. AFTER A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME ,I STARTED USING <b>KALI LINUX</b> ON A VIRTUAL MACHINE AND CURRENTLY IM USING <b>ARCH</b> FOR MOST OF THE PART TO CARRY OUT MY DAILY ROUTINE.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel">
        <p><b>MYSQL</b> IS MY FAVOURITE DBMS DUE TO IT BEING RELATIONAL AND THE DATA BEING PROPERLY STRUCTURED UNDER A WELL CONSTRUCTED AND DEFINED TABLE. I MAJORLY USE THIS DBMS TO STORE AND RETRIVE DATA FOR MY LOCALLY HOSTED NATIVE OR CROSS PLATFORM APPLICATIONS SINCE IT IS VERY EASY TO INTEGRATE IT WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING LANGUAGES SUCH AS THE <b>FLUTTER FRAMEWORK,PYTHON'S TKINTER MODULE OR THE .NET FRAMEWORK.</b> </p>
        <img src="assets/mysql.png"></img>
    </div>
    <div class="experience_panel_1">
        <img src="assets/flutter.png"></img>
        <p><b>FLUTTER</b> IS A VERSATILE FRAMEWORK FOR BUILDING CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATIONS. IT USES THE <b>DART</b> PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. I'M CURRENTLY USING FLUTTER TO BUILD ROBUST <b>MOBILE APPLICATIONS</b> AND I'M AS COMFORTABLE WITH FLUTTER AS I WAS WITH .NET MAUI DUE TO IT HAVING A REALLY STRONG COMMUNITY SUPPORT AND WELL WRITTEN DOCUMENTATION.</p>
